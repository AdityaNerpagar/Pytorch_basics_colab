# Pytorch_basics_colab

Created by referring to freeCodeCamp Pytorch tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA,
Also Implemented Deep Mutual Learning(Knowledge distillation) in file DML_v1.
File contains some test done for sake of implementation. 
Implementing DML requires training two models simultaneously.
DML involves manipulating probability distribution of both the models such that they are similar to each other with some peculiarity in them.
